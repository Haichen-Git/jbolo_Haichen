You'll probably need Charlie Hill's hdf5 file containing a grid of atmospheric mission vs (frequency, pwv, elevation).  
Download it from http://pbfs.physics.berkeley.edu/BoloCalc/ATM/atm_20201217.hdf5
and put it in here.  Your experiment's yaml file needs to
point to that file in the relevant spot (ie here; see example).
